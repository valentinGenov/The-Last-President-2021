## General info
The Last President is game with multiple years of history. It is written by team of 2 friends for a school project. 
During the process of creating the game from scratch it changed its idea multiple times.
Currently the main idea of the game is saving as much presidents as you possibly can. The game starts with some
questions about yourself - Name, Age etc. which are used later on in the game. One of the data needed to start
the rounds of the game is country. This will be used as you "starting" place where you automaticaly save one
president and you don't have to worry about the country no more. 

How does the game works? Simple... You start the round, a for loop checks your current stats and calculates
if you lose or save a presidents and people at all. After that it gives you a chance to choose country which to
go on and possibly save a president. Algorithm automaticly saves/kills a president and you can stay in the same country
you were the previous round or go to another. At the end of the for loop is the "Win" check, in which algorithm checks
your stats and determines if you win or not. Simple as that.

The way to win is simply to save 3 or more presidents before they all die.
