# The-Last-President-2021
School Project: You play the role of a soldier guiding the last remaining Presidents of the world in order to survive as long as possible during a global pandemic. You see real-time changes in the world's statistics and direct them to countries with as few deaths and infections as possible, so that they have a better chance of surviving.
